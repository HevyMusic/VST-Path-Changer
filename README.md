# VST-Path-Changer
Simply change your VST paths on your Windows machine.

# Info
* **This needs to be started as administrator, as it changes registry entries, it will tell you about it if it's started without admin rights**
* This is provided as-is, so there is no guarantee or promise
* This was made for my personal use, as I need to install FL Studio on a lot of computers and virtual machines on a daily basis for testing
* It's old and hacked together, I started a Python version with a better menu and everything, but that is something for the future if I ever have the time or find enough fun in making a better tool out of it
